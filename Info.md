# Super's Drills Mod

*This mod introduces several drills into the game that you can place on top of ores to automatically excavate them.
The ore never breaks unless you do it yourself, therefore some might consider this mod to be kind of OP, so use at your own risk and dont come complaining to me about it.
However, the drill heads have durability so beware of that. You can enchant them with unbreaking for them to last longer, and you can use Mending on them and they will auto repair from electricity.*

**Currently this mod is only available on 1.20 - 1.20.1, but i am planning to make a backport to 1.12.2.**

**Features:**
- Titanium Ore now generates in the Overworld, Nether and End
- Use a Mineral Alloyer to create Steel from Iron and Titanium
- Make a Lathe and use it to create drill heads that are enchantable and customizable with any material
- Create drills and other heavy duty excavation machinery
- Alot more stuff here and there for you to explore!

**-----------------------------------------------------------**

*It is heavily recommended to use JEI (Just Enough Items) to find recipes easier.
Drills and all other machinery in this mod use FE (Forge Energy) so you can power them with your own favourite electricity generation mods!
This is my very first mod (ever) and i could never make this mod a reality without the help of KaupenJoe and his tutorials. Please check his videos out they are really good if you want to start making mods yourself.*

Planned Updates:
- More tiers of drills to make mining more efficient
- Electricity converting system so you can convert electricity from other mods into FE (Forge Energy)
- Backport to 1.12.2
